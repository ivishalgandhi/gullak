## Why Gullak?

I originally developed Gullak for personal use. I had a habit of recording my expenses on Apple Notes â€” a quick and simple method that just got the job done. However, I needed a tool that could not only store these entries but also parse and visualize them effectively. While Gullak was created out of my own necessity, I decided to open source it to help others who might be seeking similar solutions.
